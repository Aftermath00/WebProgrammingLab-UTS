              I have nothing serious to say. Just think about very random thoughts. You know, I think that people can only meet us as deeply as they’ve met themselves. I hope someday, someone will look at you deep into your soul. I hope
              that person can understand how you come to be who you are right now, without you trying hard to explain. I hope that person can heal you without you asking for any medicine. I hope there is one day when you feel like all your
              pain back then was on purpose. Maybe your life is just written as a story with a tragic plot but ends with a happy ending.
