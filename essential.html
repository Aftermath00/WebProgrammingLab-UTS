              Why does it always feel too far? It is too far or it is just me who walks too little. Seems like I did nothing, even though I've given all my speed. Why do I have too much to change? No one gets better but I already have to
              fix the other. Feels like everything has to be started and done right now.

              Sweetie, life will always give you a lot of things to do. Surely you don't always have enough power to do all of those things. Thereâ€™s one day you feel like you're too far from where you want to be. When I was your age, I once
              read a good line that said: Some things in life are important, and some of them are good. But many people forget that only a few things in life are essential. The essential things in life are our starting line. Choose wisely.
              What are the most essential things for you as a human to live? Maybe one day you often ask yourself "Am I there yet? ``But it's not the right question, Sweetheart. The right question it's a simple "Am I started yet?". I hope
              you wisely choose your essentials. May the universe love you, happy birthday.
