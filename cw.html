              <p class="card__body">Just a random thought.</p>
              <p class="card__body">Our country is well-known as a really humble, togetherness, and “family-oriented” 
                base social culture. Even if we just walked past someone’s house, there always be some people who offer
                 us to come by their house, even though they don’t mean it. Kinda funny. Instead, people in the 
                 first-world country tend to be self-oriented or more likely to not care so much about other businesses.
                But, let me take you to one thing that I’ve been thinking about lately.</p>

      <div class="about-right">
        <div class="card">
            <div class="card__content_right">
              <div class="card__front_right">
                <p class="card__body">If we see at the transportation culture in first-world countries, let’s see a 
                    closer example. When I was in DC and Baltimore last summer, It was really different. You can 
                    actually go anywhere by subway. I observed some things there and found something interesting 
                    about the transportation culture. Even if they have different interests, maybe that person 
                    wanna go to their friend’s house, or the other person wanna go to the office, or just like us, 
                    we headed to Kedubes RI in DC, and they’re heading in the same direction, we were heading the 
                    same direction like others, same line. It’s like they have actually built a really well-designed
                    culture to also built their mindset. Philosophically, it’s like they’re saying, “Even if we 
                    have different interests, we have to find a common vision and go through that, then we can 
                    fulfill our own interests”. Conversely here in our country, we tend to use our own 
                    transportation, car, motorcycle, anything. We even have a decacorn startup company, based on 
                    single transportation use, GoJek. (Cont./)

                <br /><br />
                <p class="card__body"> People are just tryna fulfill their own interests. Well, it’s kinda sad that we don’t have good 
                    public transportation nowadays. Pardon me, we have it, but only in Jakarta. </p>
                <p class="card__body">I was scrolling through my Twitter timeline and saw an interesting tweet. 
                    So, there’s a tweet about a girl that said, “A man should have a car to date me, if they don’t, 
                    then we should just have a video call at home, or just don’t date any girl, LOL”. Replies have 
                    gone wild. But, there’s one thing that came up to my mind. That’s not wrong actually to demand 
                    comfort, there’s nothing wrong with it in my opinion. The problem is with our public 
                    transportation. If we have comfortable public transportation, walkable sidewalk, and many green 
                    open spaces, we don’t have to think or even worry about what or how are we gonna go on a date 
                    with someone. We just go by subway, bus, or anything and go anywhere.
