              Sol, before my era is totally over in your life story, I always wanted to say that I never want you to be more than who you are right now. You've been through a thousand blue days and nights and I'm so proud that I'm one of
              the witnesses who saw how hard you survived.

              I still clearly remember long ago, when I was 14, we talked about many things (literally everything) late into the night. I even once was a part of your group of friends. We once had a birthday party on the football field on a
              rainy afternoon. We sat by the sea and talked about me going to high school. You drove me to "someone's house" just to deliver his birthday present (it's gonna be a useless memory if I didn't go with you). We fought a few
              times and ignore each other but still handle it together, becoming best friends and brothers again.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5>
              Now we grew up. Unconsciously, we force ourselves to handle everything on our own. I'm not your safe place anymore and I feel sorry about that. I don't want to ask you to go back here with me or force you to put me back into
              your life story anymore. All I hope is, please let someone hold and love you right. Yes, both of us agree that the safest person we can ever meet is ourselves. But I always believe; There will always be a hand who will hold
              ours sincerely if only we open our hands to behold. You canâ€™t hold and help someone who doesn't give their hand.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5>Yours forever,</h5>
