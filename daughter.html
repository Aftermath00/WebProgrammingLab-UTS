              I found your old clothes in mom's room. I wanted to say that it smelled like you, but I don't even remember your scent. I found your wedding photo, but cannot comment on anything because I don't know what's the difference, I
              don't have enough time to remember the details of your face. I found your books,

            <h5>I don't get any, they are too high to understand. I remember you once taught me math, but I hate math now. I don't know how to remember that you were ever in my life and that's the worst thing.</h5>
            <br />
            <h5>
              Mom told me to kiss your face on that day, but I didn't, because I didn't know that would be the last chance for me. Instead of crying, I played with my friends. Laughed, as if nothing happened. But look at me now, looking for
              your existence when everything gets hard, wondering if you were here, would I be this sad? Life teaches me to take care of myself, and protect myself, but it’s not that easy. Protecting myself from my demons is not that easy,
              Dad.

            <h5>
              Mom and I never talked about you. I think you know that she always hides her feelings. She hates to be dramatic, cry, and show her sadness. She teaches me to be brave, strong, and independent. I love that. That’s cool. But
              sometimes, deep down, I can be helpless too. I can be stupid and look like hell too, and that's the moment when I extremely need you to be here and tell me that is okay because I'm just a little kid. But you can't and never
              will.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5>Sincerely,</h5>
