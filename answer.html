            <h5>Now playing : Bulan Yang Baik by Sal Priadi</h5>
            <h5>
              In the middle of a city, there lived a girl who loved a boy silently for a long time. They just barely met and did not talk that much. She never did something for her feelings but writes about that boy. One day, writing can't
              help her anymore. She keeps thinking about that boy, her feelings now are even beggar than before. She wants him. Then, that girl asked her God.
            </h5>

          <div class="col-content-R">
            <h5 class="italic">God, what should I do about this feeling?</h5>
            <h5>
              Sadly, God didn't answer her question. That girl can't tell anyone about that feeling but her God and her writings. She tried her best not to think about that boy anymore until after a long time God through this universe made
              them meet again. That girl can feel that her love was never gone. Her feelings for that boy were always there. God sent him back to her life then that girl asked again.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5 class="italic">God? Why do you send him back to my life but you don't tell me what to do?</h5>
            <h5>
              That girl is afraid of her feelings because she believes that nothing may harm women other than their feelings. She is afraid that her feelings would lead her to do something stupid that would make that boy stay away from her
              or if she does something God hates then God takes away him from her life.
            </h5>
            <br />
            <h5>In the middle of the night, she cries after praying and asks her God again.</h5>
            <h5 class="italic">
              God, I know whatever that means for me will find me. I just need to trust you, don't I? I won't let myself be controlled by my love for humans. I don't want my heart to be filled with anxiety just because of a human. Please
              make this heart only belong to you. In the name of the Bestower of Mercy, can you please tell me what should I do?
