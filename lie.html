              It's 11.42 PM on September 6, 2022. People sing I Still Love You by Overtunes out there. It's 21Â°C when I write this line. Cozy warm light in my room, four books, and 2L of mineral water on my table. I don't know what to
              write. But my mind tells me to write anything. If you read this writing now, it's already edited to be readable. I'll start now.

              I have a friend that once told me that humans are not designed to let go. We were not created to handle a loss. Then I remember what I read; The best way to stay afloat is by throwing things overboard. Letting things go only
              feels hard when you want something more than you need. In the end, we actually need very little to live. But after all, how can we feel like we lose something when we never have anything in the first place? What if it's not
              about we can't let things go but simply we can't accept that we actually own nothing? Letting go is not an art, it's a lie.
